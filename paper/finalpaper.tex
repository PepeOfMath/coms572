\begin{abstract} 

The Pokemon Trading Card Game is a popular turn-based card game usually played by two players. Its partially observable, stochastic, multi-agent nature combined with its complex rules, large state space, and demand for long-term planning make it an interesting target for modern artificial intelligence research efforts. An agent based on a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm with added knowledge via a heuristic function was developed and tested in games of PCG against human players and other agents. Although the MCTS agent performed well against random agents, its performance against human players was  worse than expected. Possible explanations for this performance gap are explored and suggestions for future research and technical enhancements are proposed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

Submission to ICML 2015 will be entirely electronic, via a web site
(not email).  Information about the submission process and \LaTeX\ templates
are available on the conference web site at:


\subsection{Background: The Pokemon Trading Card Game}

A better alternative is to use the \textbf{pdflatex} program instead of
straight \LaTeX. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, however you must
ensure that all of the fonts are embedded (use {\tt pdffonts}). If they are
not, you need to configure pdflatex to use a font map file that specifies that
the fonts be embedded. Also you should ensure that images are not downsampled
or otherwise compressed in a lossy way.

Note that the 2015 style files use the {\tt hyperref} package to
make clickable links in documents.  If this causes problems for you,
add {\tt nohyperref} as one of the options to the {\tt icml2015}
usepackage statement.

\subsection{Summary: Game Environment Characterization}

We will continue the ICML tradition in which the authors are given the
option of providing a short reaction to the initial reviews. These
reactions will be taken into account in the discussion among the
reviewers and area chairs.


\section{Methodology} 
 
All submissions must follow the same format to ensure the printer can
reproduce them without problems and to let readers more easily find
the information that they desire.

\subsection{Game Logic and State Representation}

Papers must not exceed eight (8) pages, including all figures, tables,
and appendices, but excluding references. When references are included,
the paper must not exceed ten (10) pages. Any submission that exceeds 
this page limit or that diverges significantly from the format specified 
herein will be rejected without review.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns, with an
overall width of 6.75 inches, height of 9.0 inches, and 0.25 inches
between the columns. The left margin should be 0.75 inches and the top
margin 1.0 inch (2.54~cm). The right and bottom margins will depend on
whether you print on US letter or A4 paper, but all final versions
must be produced for US letter size.

The paper body should be set in 10~point type with a vertical spacing
of 11~points. Please use Times typeface throughout the text.

\subsection{The Agent Program}

The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.


\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Tree Search Implementation}
The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.

\subsubsection{Heuristic Function}
The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.

\section{Results}
The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.

\section{Conclusion}
The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
case.
% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version. 
\section*{Acknowledgments} 
 
\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.

If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
probably should) include acknowledgements. In this case, please
place such acknowledgements in an unnumbered section at the
end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas, 
and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial 
support.

% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was
% created by Lise Getoor and Tobias Scheffer, it was slightly modified  
% from the 2010 version by Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, 
% slightly modified from the 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and 
% Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is slightly modified from 
% Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a lightly 
% changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew Moore, 
% which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and 
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
